# OOP_Assignment
Object-Oriented Programming Assignment 1
OOP Assignment 🚀

This repository contains solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment.
It demonstrates class design, inheritance, and polymorphism in Python.

📂 Files Included

assignment1.py → A custom class (Smartphone) with attributes, methods, and an inherited class (GamingSmartphone).

activity2.py → Demonstrates polymorphism with vehicles (Car, Plane, Boat) where each defines move() differently.

▶️ How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/OOP_Assignment.git
cd OOP_Assignment


Run the Python files:

python assignment1.py
python activity2.py

✨ Features

✅ Encapsulation → Using constructors (__init__) to initialize objects with unique values.

✅ Inheritance → GamingSmartphone inherits from Smartphone.

✅ Polymorphism → Different vehicle classes (Car, Plane, Boat) override the same move() method.
